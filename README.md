# About

Daily Boulders is a SPA which allows users to create/read/update/delete their daily climbing grades.

## User Stories

As a user, when signed in, I want to:
-  be able to sign up.
-  be able to sign in.
-  be able to change my password and sign out when signed in.
-  be able to create/log a day for my grade(s).
-  be able to read/see my entries.
-  be able to update my entries.
-  be able to delete my entries.
-  be able to use all actions without refreshing the page.
-  be able to use the site without any bugs.

## Technology used

-  Ruby, SQL, Rails
-  Macbook Air
-  Atom

## Steps of development:

1. I started by planning on paper and read the requirements a few times before outlining all the steps in order that I would follow.
2. Made README
3. Created one resource at a time
4. Tested all CRUD
5. Built the relation between the user and the climb.
6. Tested the relationship.
7. Tested the authorization and the CRUD together to make sure that the climbs were owned by their users on front end.
8. Ordered Index action by date
9. Finalized README.
10. 9. Deployed.


## With more time I would...

- Create a leaderboard where users can see the top daily/weekly/monthly entries of all users.
